Class: it is a user defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions.

Object: is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated.

Method: is a member function of a class,and associated with a message and an object.

Abstraction: displaying only essential information and hiding the details.

Encapsulation: as binding together the data and the functions that manipulates them

Polymorphism: a call to a member function will cause a different function to be executed depending on the type of object that invokes the function.

Overloading: refers to the ability to use a single identifier to define multiple methods of a class that differ in their input and output parameters

Attributes / Properties: an attribute is a specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file.

Class Variable: is a variable defined in a class of which a single copy exists, regardless of how many instances of the class exist.

Instance Variable: is a variable defined in a class (i.e. a member variable ), for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. 

Member Variable: is a variable that is associated with a specific object, and accessible for all its methods (member functions).

Inheritance:  is almost like embedding an object into a class.

Multiple Inheritance: where a class can inherit from more than one classes.

Composition: is useful in a C++ context because it allows us to create complex classes by combining simpler, more easily manageable parts.
